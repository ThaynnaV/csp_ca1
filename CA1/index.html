                <strong>São Paulo</strong> (/ˌsaʊ ˈpaʊloʊ/, Portuguese: [sɐ̃w̃ ˈpawlu] (audio speaker iconlisten);
                Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is a city in the Southeast Region of Brazil. Listed by the GaWC as an alpha
                global city, the municipality of São Paulo is the most populous city proper in Brazil, the Americas, the
                Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere, as well as the world's 4th largest city proper by
                population. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. The city
                serves as
                the capital of the surrounding state of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)">São
                    Paulo</a>, the most populous and wealthiest state in Brazil. It exerts strong international
                influences
                in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.<sup>[7]</sup> The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint
                Paul
                of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and
                the
                12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the
                Greater
                São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundiaí, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos) created the São Paulo
                Macrometropolis,<sup>[8]</sup> a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most
                populous
                urban agglomerations in the world.<sup>[9]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                Having the largest economy by GDP in Latin America and the Southern Hemisphere,<sup>[10]</sup> the city
                is
                home to the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Paulista Avenue is the economic core of São Paulo. The city has
                the
                11th largest GDP in the world,<sup>[11]</sup> representing alone 10.7% of all Brazilian
                GDP<sup>[12]</sup>
                and 36% of the production of goods and services in the state of São Paulo, being home to 63% of
                established
                multinationals in Brazil,<sup>[13]</sup> and has been responsible for 28% of the national scientific
                production in 2005, as measured by the number of science papers published in journals.<sup>[14]</sup>

                The region of modern-day São Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the Tietê River, was
                inhabited
                by the Tupi people, such as the Tupiniquim, Guaianas, and Guarani. Other tribes also lived in areas that
                today form the metropolitan region.<sup>[20]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                The region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the
                Europeans.<sup>[21]</sup> The most notable cacique was Tibiriça, known for his support for the
                Portuguese
                and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc,
                that
                survive today are Tietê, Ipiranga, Tamanduateí, Anhangabaú, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia,
                Itapevi,
                Barueri, Embu-Guaçu etc.

            <p>
                São Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3
                million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of
                the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 9 million inhabitants of São Paulo, 50% (4.5
                million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. São Paulo has more descendants of Italians than
                any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).<sup>[66]</sup>
